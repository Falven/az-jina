# F02 - thinapps-shared replacement (az-reader feature/az)

## Acceptance criteria
- az-reader builds and runs locally (or in container) without the private submodule.
- Tests cover at least:
  - auth middleware/hook behavior (stubs OK but contract enforced)
  - settings/env parsing
  - common error formatting if thinapps-shared provides it

## Status
- Completed 2026-01-21; build + tests via `pnpm -C az-reader run build` and `pnpm -C az-reader test` (see `notes/commands.log`).
